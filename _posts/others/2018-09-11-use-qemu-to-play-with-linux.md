## Introduction

If you are curious about Linux Kernel development, but feel afraid of
accidentally breaking your system due to experiments, the answer for such
problems can be summarized in one technology: Virtual Machine (VM). In this
tutorial, we'll examine how to use QEMU, which is an extremely powerful
hardware virtualization tool that can be used in many different contexts. I
particularly appreciate QEMU because it's a very popular tool (thus easy to 
find information about it on the Internet), it's updated constantly,
it features rich machine emulation, it's free software, and it
was originally designed for development.

QEMU is a generic machine emulator based on dynamic translation [3] that can
operate in two different modes [2]:

* **Full system emulation**: A mode that completely emulates a computer. It
  can be used to launch different Operating Systems (OS);
* **User mode emulation**: Enables launching a process for one sort of CPU on
  another CPU.

If you have an `x86` machine, you can use QEMU with KVM and achieve high
performance.

## Prerequisites: Installing QEMU and KVM

To follow this tutorial you need to install QEMU and Samba Client (for sharing
between your host and guest).

### Arch Linux

Install Arch Linux packages [1]:

```bash
sudo pacman -S qemu samba qemu-arch-extra
```

### Debian

Install Debian packages [2]:

```bash
sudo apt install qemu samba samba-client
```

## Creating an image

We want QEMU running a Linux distribution for our future experiments with
Linux. With this goal in mind, we have to create an image disk with the
following command:

```bash
qemu-img create -f qcow2 kernel_experiments 15G
```
**Attention:**
Don't just simply copy and paste the command above or any other found in this tutorial, try
to understand it thoroughly, by reading it dissected below.
{: .notice_warning}


* `qemu-img`: It's the disk image utility provided by QEMU;
  * `create`: Indicates that we want to create new QEMU disk image;
  * `-f qcow2`: Specifies the image format; usually, you want 'raw' or
    'qcow2'. Raw images are fast, but it uses all the determined size at once;
    on the other hand, qcow2 is a little bit slower, but it increases the image
    size based on VM usage;
  * `kernel_experiments`: This could be anything, really. It's just the output file name QEMU will store the generated image;
  * `15G`: The image size.

In this tutorial, I recommend using qcow2 with 10 or 15G.

Check that the command before succedded by typing:
```bash
file kernel_experiments
```

The output should be something similar to `kernel_experiments: QEMU QCOW Image (v3), 16106127360 bytes`

## Installing a distro

Next, download any Linux distribution image you want to use (I recommend
Debian or ArchLinux, but it can be any). With your QEMU image file created above and your distro's ISO, follow the command below:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom ~/PATH/TO/YOUR_DISTRO_ISO.iso -boot order=d -drive \
                   file=kernel_experiments,format=qcow2 -m 2G
```

**Notice:**
The command above will start up a VM and mount the ISO file you've downloaded on it. After installation has finished, it'll reboot the VM automatically, just close the window after it finished installing.
{: .notice_warning}

Proceed with the installation, and come back here after you finish. For the sake of simplicity, create a user in the VM that match with your host machine
user.

## Booting up a QEMU VM

Finally, it is time to start the machine. Take a look at the command below and
adapt it for your needs:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -net nic -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22,smb=$PWD/ \
                   -daemonize -m 2G -smp cores=4,cpus=4 kernel_experiments
```

* `qemu-system-x86_64`: Command that start the QEMU VM.
  * `-enable-kvm`: Enable full virtualization by using KVM [5];
  * `-net`: Network options;
  * `-daemonize`: Daemonize the QEMU process after initialization;
  * `-m`: RAM size;
  * `-smp`: Simulate a SMP system with n CPUs.

This will pop up a window with the recently installed distribution from the step before. For a detailed information about options used in this command, take a look at the man page.

**Notice:**
In some distros, the command above fails or show a warning due to the
`-enable-kvm` parameter. Probably, your host user isn't part of the KVM
group. You can fix it by adding yourself to the KVM group. For example:
`sudo usermod -a -G kvm $USER`
{: .notice_warning}

## Configuring ssh (optional)

At this point, it's possible to log in and out of the VM, but it requires typing the VM's user's password
every single time. Followings steps below will create a passwordless ssh conection, using an RSA key pair

**Info:**
There's so many ways for setting up an SSH connection; here's a 1000
foot view of the process.
{: .notice_info}

First, create an RSA key pair on the host machine (if there isn't any already) with the command:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Explaining the command above is beyond this tutorial. There's plenty information about it on the Internet [4]. 
After the key is set up, you need to prepare the recently created VM to accept ssh connections. Just install the
package `openssh` on it (Arch: openssh, Debian: openssh-server).

Because this is a fresh installation, you will need to temporally enable password
authentication in the VM in order to log in from the host machine.
Follow the steps below:

1. In the VM: `sudo sed -i 's/#.*PasswordAuthentication.*/PasswordAuthentication yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config`;
2. Restart the service: `sudo systemctl restart sshd`.

Now, from the host machine test logging in into the VM with:

```
ssh -p 2222 127.0.0.1
```

**Notice**
Note that the command above will try to log int to VM using the default host's username, which is $USER.
{: .notice_warning}

If everything works as expected, at this point, you're probably accessing the VM's shell. 
Moving on, log out of the VM, and from the host machine type the following:

```
ssh-copy-id -p 2222 $USER@127.0.0.1
```

Try to reaccess the VM, open the file `sshd_config`, comment the line with
`PasswordAuthentication`, restart the `sshd` service, and leave the VM.
Finally, try to ssh into the VM, and you will be able to access the machine
using your ssh key.

## Conclusion

Keep in mind that we just scratched QEMU's surface, this tool provides a lot of
features and have other tools to make VM management easy. Finally,
follow my feed for new tutorials about QEMU and Linux development.
